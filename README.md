## Obsidian Plugin: Backlinks into the document

A hacky workaround which put backlinks section into the document.

Works with Obsidian 0.9.7+

### How it works
Plugin creates a pane with backlinks and move that into the active document. 
When you change your active document it will move backlinks section into new active document and update the content.

### Plans for future
- Remove this plugin when official solution will come

### How to install the plugin
- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `vault/.obsidian/plugins/plugin-id/`.
